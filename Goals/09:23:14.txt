1.  Double check SIMBAD coordinates are from 2000.
2.  Remove stars that were not on cluster list from script!
3.  Use Johan's spreadsheet for binaries to find the real seperation (more digits).
		Need 3 digit precision to incorporate the error!
		Fix seperation for PSF also!
4.  For binary PA, Johan's uncertainty is not here.
		Just use the blanket uncertainty.
5.  For binary sep, use quadratic sum of his uncertainty with blanket.
		Include blanket for all faint companions!!
6.  For single stars, use conversion from App to Abs!
		Make new table for singles!!
