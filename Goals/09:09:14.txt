Goals from 09/09/14:

Go through new stars and make calculations with 3 pix aperature.
For M409 & M42, make same sized aperature on opposite side of star to estimate leakage.  Then subtract it from brighness of companion.
Fix B1 for new values.
Fix Hogg5 magnitudes using the equation in notes.
Compute abs. magnitude for single stars similar to what needs to be done for Hogg5.
Build table with HD names for all stars (including singles).  Also include multiplicities.  Sort by cluster.
	Take from newest cataloge, use coordinates on SIMBAD. (Emailed recently.)
	Use script on SIMBAD with coordinates to return names for all stars. (Example was emailed to me.)
Retrieve Isochrones!!
