Goals for 10/21/14:
1.  Finish up leakage calculations.
2.  Isochron interpolation / poly fit.
3.  Find new source for age of clusters (literature search).
	a. Age, original reference, and the method used to find the age.
	b. Sidenote: There may be some disccusion where they guess where the age is.  If so, find also! (may be hidden in analysis section)
4.  If there is extra time, plot the magnitudes on the isochron!
