On bright end of data, flag down spec. types!
Make histogram of masses of targets (Kband) (sing & binaries).
For all stars, find STD of masses from J, H, & K filters.
Make color mag. Diagram, K vs. J-K and/or K vs H-K for each cluster seperately!!!
Also make one with all cluster plots on the same plot, distinguishable by color!

For single stars, add uncertainty to AbsK, find corresponding Mass, take the difference above & below from the Mass already listed!
Data and method for articles for age! Take notes!
