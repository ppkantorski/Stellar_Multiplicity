Goals from 09/16/14:

For Astrometry,
	Hogg 13 & M141-2 need Sep. to be rescaled by .0495/.05! (uncertanties from PSF)
	For psf stars, use quad. sum of STDs for error estimation.
		Find calibration uncertainty from website for blanket calibration for astrometry.
	Only fill in uncertainty for Sep. and PA!

For photometry,
	PSF Stars ~ 0.05 mag or 5% should be use for Delta J, H, K unless uncertainty is larger.
	Use blanket of .03 mag for binaries unless spreadsheet has a larger uncertainty.
	Use half distance for undertainty of binaries
	Find error associated with cluster distances.
	Only fill in uncertainty for delta j, h, and k.
	
(!) Double check my values are use for missing binaries and final missed!!

From before:
	Compute abs. magnitude for single stars similar to what needs to be done for Hogg5.
	Build table with HD names for all stars (including singles).  Also include multiplicities.  Sort by cluster.
		Take from newest cataloge, use coordinates on SIMBAD. (Emailed recently.)
		Use script on SIMBAD with coordinates to return names for all stars. (Example was emailed to me.)
		(!) Atleast try to run the script on a few stars...
	Retrieve Isochrones!!
		use 0.1 -> 7 Solar mass (primaries and companions will be within range!)
		Below 0.5 solar mass, some of the calculations are not correct...
		Will create another set to stitch to upper solar mass bound.
